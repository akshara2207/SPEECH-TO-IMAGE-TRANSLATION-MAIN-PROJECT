**INTRODUCTION** 
 
To develop an end-to-end system that interprets spoken language and generates corresponding visual
content.To explore and improve the integration between speech recognition systems and image
generation models.This project aims to explore the intersection of speech recognition and image
generation technologies, addressing challenges such as accurate transcription of speech, semantic
understanding of the input text, and high-quality image synthesis.A novel deep architecture and
GAN formulation are proposed to effectively bridge these advances in text and image modeling,
translating visual concepts from characters to pixels.
